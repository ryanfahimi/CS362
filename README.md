# CS 362: Foundations of AI

This repository contains code and written assignments completed for CS 362 at the University of San Francisco.

The course introduced core concepts in **artificial intelligence**, focusing on practical implementations of search, inference, and learning techniques. Topics included:

* Search algorithms and intelligent agent behavior
* Probabilistic reasoning and decision-making under uncertainty
* Supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods

Coursework combined programming tasks with written reflections on the societal and ethical implications of AI.
